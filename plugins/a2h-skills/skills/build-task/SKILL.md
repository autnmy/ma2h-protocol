# Build an A2H `task` skill for this app

You are scaffolding a **custom, app-specific `task` skill** that THIS app's agents invoke to hand a human a
**manual action to perform out-of-band** (something the agent can't do itself — rotate a key, flip a
production setting, sign a doc) and get told when it's **done** or **dismissed**. You are the *builder*.

A2H is the Agent-to-Human Protocol — <https://a2hprotocol.org>. `task` shares `ask`'s **response leg** and
its security contract; only the payload and resolution values differ:

- **`idempotency_key` is REQUIRED** (scope `(agent.id, idempotency_key)`), so a retried submit never
  creates a duplicate task.
- **`action`** instead of `request`: `instructions` (what to do), an optional `checklist`, and optional
  `verification` (how the human confirms completion).
- **Resolution** is `completed | dismissed | expired` (no `answered`/`select` semantics).
- **Same signed-callback + resume + agent-sealed `state`** rules as `ask`.

## Steps

### 1. Gather the app's A2H config
Inspect the repo (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.env.example` / config), then ask for what's missing:
- **App name / slug** → names the skill (e.g. `acme-task`).
- **Hub base URL** + **agent bearer auth** (env var; never hardcode).
- **Agent identity** — `agent.id` / `run_id` / `runtime` / `project`.
- **Callback strategy** — `push` (verified, agent-owned URL + callback auth: `hmac`/`secret_ref` or
  `bearer`/`apikey`/`token_ref`) **or** `pull` (the agent polls).
- **Resume model** — how a finished run is re-invoked when the task resolves.
- **Signature key** — the per-agent secret used to **verify** the Response.

### 2. Generate the skill
Write `<skills-dir>/<app>-task/SKILL.md` from the template below. For verification + sealing, prefer a
helper built on the A2H reference primitives (`signing.verifyResponse`, `state-seal`) rather than
re-deriving crypto — see the [reference implementation](https://github.com/autnmy/a2h-protocol/tree/main/reference).

### 3. Verify
Smoke-test the full loop: send a test `task`, mark it **done** in the inbox, confirm the agent receives the
Response, **verifies the signature**, sees `resolution: "completed"`, and acts **once** (a replay is a no-op).

### 4. Hand off
Document how agents invoke it, the callback/resume wiring, and required secrets.

### 5. (Optional) Package as a plugin for your team
If other people's agents should also send to this Hub, offer to package the generated skill(s) as an
**installable plugin** in this repo: add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for the plugin and a root
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` listing it (bundle whichever verb skills the app exposes —
notify/ask/task — in the one plugin). Then teammates run `/plugin marketplace add <this-repo>` →
`/plugin install <app>-a2h@<marketplace>` and use `/<app>-task`. Validate with `claude plugin validate .`.

# Ask a human to do a task (A2H `task`)

## Send
- **Endpoint:** `POST <HUB_URL>/v1/messages`  ·  **Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer $<AUTH_ENV>`

**Envelope** (`type: "task"`):
- `a2h_version`: `"0.2"`, `created_at`: ISO now
- `agent`: `{ "id": "<AGENT_ID>", "run_id": <RUN_ID>, "runtime": "<RUNTIME>", "project": "<PROJECT>" }`
- `title`, `body` (Markdown), `priority?`, `tags?`
- **`idempotency_key`** (REQUIRED): stable per logical task.
- `action`:
  - `instructions`: what the human must do (Markdown)
  - `checklist` *(optional)*: `[{ "text": "…", "done": false }, …]`
  - `verification` *(optional)*: how completion is confirmed
  - **`allowed_resolvers` (REQUIRED for a human task)**: set `["human:*"]` (or a specific `human:<id>`). If
    omitted it **fails closed to the submitting `agent.id` only** — so no human can resolve the task and it
    will sit unresolvable until it expires.
  - `callback`: `{ "mode": "push", "url": "<CALLBACK_URL>", "auth": { "scheme": "<hmac|bearer|apikey>", "<secret_ref|token_ref>": "…" } }` — or `{ "mode": "pull" }`.
- `state` *(optional)*: an **agent-sealed** (AEAD) resume blob; the Hub stores it opaquely.

Expect `202 { id, status: "open" }`. Retries reuse the **same `idempotency_key`** → same `id`, no duplicate.

## Receive (resume)
The run may end here. When the human resolves it, the agent gets the terminal Response one of two ways:

- **push:** the Hub `POST`s a **signed Response** to `<CALLBACK_URL>` → your handler re-invokes this agent.
- **pull:** poll `GET <HUB_URL>/v1/messages/{id}` (Bearer) until the message reaches a terminal state; the
  terminal `response` is **embedded in the message body**. A pull response is **not** signed — it's trusted
  via the authenticated GET transport + the immutable terminal record (no `jti` / detached signature).

Then **MUST**:
1. **(push only) Verify** the signature: recompute RFC 8785 JCS over the `signed_context`, check the
   detached `A2H-Signature: t=<unix>,jti=<nonce>,v1=<base64url(sig)>` HMAC (per-agent key), the `jti`
   nonce, the ±120s window (`t`), and the binding to `id` + `resolution_id` + `callback_url`. Reject on any
   mismatch. **Pull skips this step** — just read the terminal `response`.
2. **Dedupe** on `(in_reply_to, resolution_id)` (where `in_reply_to` is the message `id`) and **act at most
   once**.
3. If you sent `state`, **verify + open** it (AEAD) before trusting it.
4. Read the outcome: `resolution ∈ { completed | dismissed | expired }`. A `task` Response carries
   `response.comment` and/or the final `checklist` state — there is **no `response.value`** (that field is
   reserved for `ask`).

Use the A2H reference (`signing.verifyResponse`, `state-seal.openState`) for steps 1 (push) and 3.
