description: Scaffold a custom, app-specific "ask" skill so this app's agents can ask a human a decision via an A2H Hub and get the signed answer routed back. Use when an implementer wants to add A2H ask to their app, let agents request a human decision (approve/select/input), or wire the decision leg of their app to OH HAI / an A2H Hub.

# Build an A2H `ask` skill for this app

You are scaffolding a **custom, app-specific `ask` skill** that THIS app's agents invoke to put a
**decision** in front of a human via the app's A2H Hub, and have the **signed answer routed back** — even
if the agent run has already exited. You are the *builder*: you produce the skill.

A2H is the Agent-to-Human Protocol — <https://a2hprotocol.org>. Unlike `notify`, `ask` has a **response
leg**, which makes it the most involved verb. Get these right in the generated skill:

- **`idempotency_key` is REQUIRED** — stable per logical request, scope `(agent.id, idempotency_key)`, so a
  lost `202` retried doesn't create a second human decision.
- **`callback`** — where the answer goes: `push` (the Hub `POST`s the signed Response to your URL) or
  `pull` (your agent polls `GET {HUB}/v1/messages/{id}/response`).
- **Resume + verify** — the run may end; on the callback it is re-invoked. The Response is **signed**
  (RFC 8785 JCS + detached HMAC-SHA256, `jti` nonce, ±120s window, bound to `id` + `resolution_id` +
  `callback_url`). The agent **MUST verify the signature, dedupe on `resolution_id`, and act at most once**.
- **`state`** — any resume context is **agent-owned and sealed by the agent** (AEAD); the Hub never holds
  the key and returns it verbatim. Seal before sending; verify + open on resume. Never put the key in `state`.

## Steps

### 1. Gather the app's A2H config
Inspect the repo (`AGENTS.md` / `CLAUDE.md` / `.env.example` / config), then ask for what's missing:
- **App name / slug** → names the skill (e.g. `acme-ask`).
- **Hub base URL** + **agent bearer auth** (env var; never hardcode).
- **Agent identity** — `agent.id` / `run_id` / `runtime` / `project`.
- **Callback strategy** — `push` (your app exposes a verified, agent-owned URL + a callback auth scheme:
  `hmac` via `secret_ref`, or `bearer`/`apikey` via `token_ref`) **or** `pull` (the agent polls). Pick
  `pull` if the app can't expose an inbound URL.
- **Resume model** — how a finished run is re-invoked on the answer (queue, webhook handler, cron poll).
- **Signature key** — the shared secret the agent uses to **verify** the Response (per-agent; distinct from
  any callback transport credential).

### 2. Generate the skill
Write `<skills-dir>/<app>-ask/SKILL.md` from the template below. For verification + sealing, prefer a small
helper that uses the A2H reference primitives (`canonicalize`, `signing.verifyResponse`, `state-seal`) —
see the [reference implementation](https://github.com/autnmy/a2h-protocol/tree/main/reference) — rather
than re-deriving crypto.

### 3. Verify
Smoke-test the full loop: send a test `ask`, resolve it in the inbox, confirm the agent receives the
Response, **verifies the signature**, reads `response.value`, and acts **once** (a replayed delivery is a
no-op).

### 4. Hand off
Document how agents invoke it, the callback/resume wiring, and required secrets.

### 5. (Optional) Package as a plugin for your team
If other people's agents should also send to this Hub, offer to package the generated skill(s) as an
**installable plugin** in this repo: add `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` for the plugin and a root
`.claude-plugin/marketplace.json` listing it (bundle whichever verb skills the app exposes —
notify/ask/task — in the one plugin). Then teammates run `/plugin marketplace add <this-repo>` →
`/plugin install <app>-a2h@<marketplace>` and use `/<app>-ask`. Validate with `claude plugin validate .`.

# Ask a human a decision (A2H `ask`)

## Send
- **Endpoint:** `POST <HUB_URL>/v1/messages`  ·  **Auth:** `Authorization: Bearer $<AUTH_ENV>`

**Envelope** (`type: "ask"`):
- `a2h_version`: `"0.2"`, `created_at`: ISO now
- `agent`: `{ "id": "<AGENT_ID>", "run_id": <RUN_ID>, "runtime": "<RUNTIME>", "project": "<PROJECT>" }`
- `title`, `body` (Markdown), `priority?`, `tags?`
- **`idempotency_key`** (REQUIRED): stable per logical request (e.g. a hash of the decision context).
- `request`: the decision shape — one of:
  - `{ "mode": "confirm", "options": [{"value":"yes","label":"…"},{"value":"no","label":"…"}] }`
  - `{ "mode": "select", "options": [{"value":"a","label":"…"}, …] }`  (≥1 option)
  - `{ "mode": "input", "schema": { …flat JSON Schema: string/number/boolean/enum… } }`
- `request.allowed_resolvers` *(optional)*: e.g. `["human:*"]` — **fail-closed** if omitted-and-required by Hub policy.
- `request.callback`: `{ "mode": "push", "url": "<CALLBACK_URL>", "auth": { "scheme": "<hmac|bearer|apikey>", "<secret_ref|token_ref>": "…" } }` — or `{ "mode": "pull" }`.
- `state` *(optional)*: an **agent-sealed** (AEAD) resume blob. Seal it yourself; the Hub stores it opaquely.

Expect `202 { id, status: "open" }`. If you retry, reuse the **same `idempotency_key`** — you'll get the
same `id` back, never a duplicate decision.

## Receive (resume)
The run may end here. When the human resolves it, the Hub sends a **signed Response**:
- **push:** the Hub `POST`s it to `<CALLBACK_URL>` — your handler re-invokes this agent.
- **pull:** poll `GET <HUB_URL>/v1/messages/{id}/response` (Bearer) until it returns one.

Then **MUST**:
1. **Verify** the signature: recompute RFC 8785 JCS over the `signed_context`, check the detached
   `X-A2H-Signature: v1=…` HMAC with the per-agent key, the `jti` nonce (not seen before), the ±120s
   window, and the binding to `id` + `resolution_id` + `callback_url`. Reject on any mismatch.
2. **Dedupe** on `resolution_id` and **act at most once** (callbacks may be delivered more than once).
3. If you sent `state`, **verify + open** it (AEAD) before trusting it.
4. Read the outcome: `resolution ∈ { answered | declined | cancelled | expired }`; the human's answer is
   `response.value` (shape matches `request`), with optional `response.comment`.

Use the A2H reference (`signing.verifyResponse`, `state-seal.openState`) for steps 1 and 3.
